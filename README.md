   at Program.<Main>$(String[] args) in C:\Code\Christoffer-kk2-robust\Program.cs:line 2

* Fixed by adding a try catch to the load method in Shoppinglist class..

## Error 2:
If user types a non-number character as price, the program will crash.

* Fixed by adding a try catch. Also put input price in a whileloop so when prohibited character is used, user will be asked to input price again. *
